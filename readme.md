# Scalable Grid System App

This is a Rails application that runs behind the scenes every time you visit the http://scalable.gs website. The most notable thing is the generate controller that that runs every time a user wants a custom version of the scalable grid system.

Unless you specifically remove it in the customisation options, every download comes bundles with the latest official version of HTML 5 Boilerplate.
